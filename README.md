# Oblivity
A terminal-based application that assigns a definitive name to describe the identity of the user.

The user will enter the appropriate information as prompted by a series of questions. The identity of the user will be measured on the Oblivity Scale. 

This application is written in raw Python and built for Windows, but will probably work for most platforms. It *should* work on machines running versions of Python 3.2 or higher. No special installers, such as pip, or external compilers are needed. It is fully portable, assuming you have Python installed.

This is in very early development. You can reach the developer here: granular041@gmail.com. He can't program too well, but he finds it entertaining and satisfying.

Please see the public disclosure file for important information.
